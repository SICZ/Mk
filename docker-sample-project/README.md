# [*Project Title*]
**This Docker image is not aimed at public consumption.
It exists to serve as a single endpoint for SICZ projects.**

[*One Paragraph of project description goes here*]

## Contents

This container only contains essential components:
* [[*BASE IMAGE NAME*]](https://github.com/[*AUTHOR*]/[*BASE IMAGE REPOSITORY*]) provide [*BASE IMAGE DESCRIPTION*].
* [*PROJECT*]([*PROJECT URL*]) [*PROJECT DESCRIPTION*].

## Getting started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your
local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes
on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisities

[*What things you need to install the software and how to install them*]

### Installing

[*A step by step series of examples that tell you have to get a development env running*]

Clone the GitHub repository into your working directory:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/[*AUTHOR*]/[*REPOSITORY*]
```

### Usage

[*A step by step series of examples that tell you how to build and run Docker container*]

Use the command `make` to simplify the Docker container development tasks:
```bash
make all                # Build a new image and run the tests
make ci                 # Build a new image and run the tests
make build              # Build a new image
make rebuild            # Build a new image without using the Docker layer caching
make config-file        # Display the configuration file for the current configuration
make vars               # Display the make variables for the current configuration
make up                 # Remove the containers and then run them fresh
make create             # Create the containers
make start              # Start the containers
make stop               # Stop the containers
make restart            # Restart the containers
make rm                 # Remove the containers
make wait               # Wait for the start of the containers
make ps                 # Display running containers
make logs               # Display the container logs
make logs-tail          # Follow the container logs
make shell              # Run the shell in the container
make test               # Run the tests
make test-all           # Run tests for all configurations
make test-shell         # Run the shell in the test container
make secrets            # Create the Simple CA secrets
make clean              # Remove all containers and work files
make docker-pull        # Pull all images from the Docker Registry
make docker-pull-dependencies # Pull the project image dependencies from the Docker Registry
make docker-pull-image  # Pull the project image from the Docker Registry
make docker-pull-testimage # Pull the test image from the Docker Registry
make docker-push        # Push the project image into the Docker Registry
```
